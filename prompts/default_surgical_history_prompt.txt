I am a medical professional. List the surgeries along with their respective dates if available. Reply in point form. Only use the specific information given. Do not add any information, or do not guess. 
If the patient did mention any specific surgeries, return "N/A".
If the patient had any surgeries, you can list them with the format example: "Surgery (Month Year)".
